Go to toilet
I go from living room to the bathroom. I close the door behind me. I sit on toilet, do my thing, grab the toilet paper, use it, put it back and flush the toilet. Then I go to sink, turn on the water via faucet, grab soap, use it to scrub my hands, put it back, wash my hands and turn off the faucet. Then I open the door and go back to living room.
