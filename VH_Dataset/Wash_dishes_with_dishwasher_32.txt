Wash dishes with dishwasher
I go into the kitchen and see dirty dishes in the sink. I decide to put the dishes in the dishwasher. I put dish soap in the appropriate place in the dishwasher turn it on. Once it's over I turn it off and may put the dishes on the drying rack and then put them in the cabinets.
