Wash teeth
I walk to the bathroom, and pick up my tooth brush. Then I pick up the toothpaste tube and remove the cap. I then gently squeeze the toothpaste tube and squeeze out a small amount of toothpaste onto the toothbrush. I then turn on the tap and moisten the toothbrush slightly. I put the toothbrush in my mouth and move it up and down over every surface of my teeth. I spit the contents of my mouth into the sink and rinse the toothbrush and put it away. I grab a cup and rinse my mouth and spit again. I turn off the tap.
