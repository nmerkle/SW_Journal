Wash teeth
I go to the bathroom.  I find my toothbrush, tooth paste, cup and faucet.  I grab the toothbrush out of the toothbrush holder and tooth paste and apply the tooth paste to the toothbrush.  I put down the tooth paste and then brush my teeth with the toothbrush.  Once finished I take the toothbrush out of my mouth and spit the remaining paste out.  I then turn on the cold water faucet. I rinse the toothbrush and put it into the toothbrush holder.  I grab the cup and fill it with water.  I turn off the faucet.  I put the water in my mouth, swish it and then spit it into the sink. I put the cup down.
