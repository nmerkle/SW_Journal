Put groceries in Fridge
I spot the grocery bag.  I pick it up and take it to the kitchen.  I find and remove the bread and place it on the counter.  I find the cheese and apples, open the refrigerator and place them inside.  I close the refrigerator.  I find the oatmeal, grab it and put it away in the pantry.
