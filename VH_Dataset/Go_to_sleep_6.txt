Go to sleep
I walk to the bedroom.  I remove my clothes and put them in the laundry basket.  I walk to my dresser and open it. I find my pajamas and put them on.  I turn off the light and make my way to bed.  I pull the comforter and sheets back and climb into bed.  I lay down and put my head on the pillow.  I put back the comforter and sheets over me and go to sleep.
