Wash teeth
I walk to the bathroom and find my toothbrush. I find the toothpaste and put it on my brush. I put the brush in my mouth and brush each section of my teeth. I put down the toothpaste. After 30 seconds of brushing I go to the sink. I spit into the sink and rinse my mouth and my toothbrush under the faucet.
