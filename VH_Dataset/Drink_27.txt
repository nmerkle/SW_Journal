Drink
I walk the kitchen and walk up to the kitchen cabinet. I open the cabinet and take out a cup. I walk to sink and I turn the faucet on using the cold water handle. I put my cup under the running water until it is full. I turn off the cold water handle and bring the cup to my mouth and take a drink.
