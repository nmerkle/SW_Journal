I walk to my office. I take a seat in front of my desk. I move my mouse around and turn on my computer. Once my computer is on, I type in my password. Once I'm on my desktop, I locate Google Chrome browser. I double-tap on that icon to enter the browser. I type in a web address to navigate to that location. I navigate to another web address when I am bored of the one I'm currently at.
