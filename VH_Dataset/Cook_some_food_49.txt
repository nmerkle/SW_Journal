Cook some food
I go to the kitchen and turn on the oven to pre-heat. I grab what I'm cooking from the fridge and place it in a casserole. Then I place it in the oven and set a timer. Once the timer rings, I use oven mitts to open the oven door, take the casserole and close it again. I switch off the oven. The food is cooked.
